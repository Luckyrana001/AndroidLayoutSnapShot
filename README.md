# AndroidLayoutSnapShot

This example is used to merge two images into a single image.

To do this i have developed a xml frame layout and then i am adding two images to the frame layout.

and then on Capture Screenshot button click , capturing bitmap of layout and passing that to File and saving the file in sd card folder.
